-- Migration: 20260601000001_matchmaking_perf_indexes
-- Description: Add composite indexes to matchmaking_queue to fix high-latency
--              queries that were doing full-table scans on (game, game_mode, status).
--
-- NOTE: matchmaking_queue.status is INTEGER (see 20240928000001_create_core_tables):
--   0=waiting, 1=matched, 2=expired, 3=cancelled
-- Earlier revisions of this file used string literals ('waiting' / 'matched') in
-- the partial-index WHERE clauses, which fails with
--   ERROR: invalid input syntax for type integer: "waiting"
-- on PostgreSQL because the status column is INTEGER, not TEXT.

-- Composite index used by the background worker's active-game queries and by
-- the stats handler.  Replaces the separate (status) and (game, game_mode)
-- indexes for queries that filter on all three columns.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_matchmaking_queue_game_mode_status
    ON matchmaking_queue (game, game_mode, status);

-- Partial index for the common hot path: only waiting entries.
-- Keeps the index small and fast for the matchmaker worker.
-- status INTEGER: 0=waiting, 1=matched, 2=expired, 3=cancelled
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_matchmaking_queue_waiting
    ON matchmaking_queue (game, game_mode, joined_at)
    WHERE status = 0;

-- Composite index for the average-wait-time aggregate query which filters on
-- (status = 1 (matched), matched_at IS NOT NULL, joined_at >= ...).
--
-- matchmaking_queue uses `joined_at` (not `created_at`) to record when a
-- player enters the queue — see 20240928000001_create_core_tables.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_matchmaking_queue_matched_stats
    ON matchmaking_queue (game, game_mode, joined_at)
    WHERE status = 1 AND matched_at IS NOT NULL;
