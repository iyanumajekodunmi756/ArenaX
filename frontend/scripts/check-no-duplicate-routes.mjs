/**
 * Fails if any user-facing page route exists under src/app/ outside of
 * src/app/[locale]/ (issue #729).
 *
 * next-intl's middleware (localePrefix: "always") already redirects every
 * non-locale-prefixed request to its /<locale>/... equivalent, so a page
 * file placed directly under src/app/ (e.g. src/app/matches/[id]/page.tsx)
 * is never actually reachable by real traffic -- it's dead code that's
 * easy to add by accident (e.g. copy-pasting a route while it's still
 * being built) and easy to forget to delete once the [locale] version
 * lands. This check keeps routes from silently duplicating again.
 *
 * Allowed outside src/app/[locale]/:
 *  - src/app/api/**            (API routes are not localized pages)
 *  - src/app/layout.tsx        (root layout is required by Next.js)
 *  - src/app/{sitemap,robots}.ts / manifest.ts  (site-wide metadata routes)
 *  - global-error.tsx           (must be defined at the root per Next.js)
